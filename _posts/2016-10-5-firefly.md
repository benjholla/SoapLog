## Recipe
Combine all oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Add the charcoal, clay, and fragrance oils, blending well. After reaching a heavy trace, add the bug repellent soap balls and hand stir to evenly distribute the balls. Pour the batch into the mold and let the mold sit overnight before cutting. Let cure for four weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
Some of the balls tended to cluster into the center. In the future I would make the balls smaller and soap at a lower temperature so that the soap balls would be suspended and stay more evenly distributed when I poured the soap into the mold.
