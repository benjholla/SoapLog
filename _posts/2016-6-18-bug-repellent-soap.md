## Recipe
Combine all oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Stir in clay powder, coarse bentonite, and collrant. Add and mix in essential oils. Pour the mixture into the soap mold. 

## Batch Notes
This smells like a bug repellent. I can't imagine using the citronella in anything else. I hope it works! It should make a good camp soap.
