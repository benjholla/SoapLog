## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Stir in the fragrance and colorant to the oil. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Pour into mold. Release the soap from the mold and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
The fruit scents of the fragrance did not come out with the low amount of fragrance oil that was added (we added it at about half strength) and it only retained the herbal floral smells although it seems to work ok in this soap.
