## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Stir the clay and coffee grounds into the oil. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Pour into the mold and let the batch sit overnight. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
I made a coffee butter starting with 11 ounces of coconut oil, 4 ounces shea butter, and 4 ounces of cocoa butter. I heated the oils until the oils flowed smoothly (being careful not to scorch the oils) and simmered in 100 grams of medium ground Colombian coffee for 8 hours. Afterwards I strained the oil through a coffee filter to remove the used coffee grounds. The oiled flowed smoothly through the coffee filter when it was hot. The smell of the shea butter and cocoa butter with the coffee smelled like a rich mocha coffee. Of the 19 ounces of oil, I seemed to have lost 17% of the original oils (leaving me with 15.77 ounces of the coffee butter). I adjusted the final recipe accordingly to bring the batch to 32 ounces by assuming that I had 83% of each oil originally used to create the coffee butter, that is a final 3.32 ounces of cocoa butter, 3.32 ounces of shea butter, and 9.13 ounces of coconut oil.
