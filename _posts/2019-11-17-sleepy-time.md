## Recipe
Create tea and then chill before using as a lye water base. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in fragrance oil. Split batch and add in the colorants swirling in the bowl. Pour into mold. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
The tea (most likely the valerian root) gave a sulfur-like odor for the first few weeks which later faded and left a very pleasant smell.
