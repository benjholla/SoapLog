## Recipe
At trace add bentonite, honey, and essential oils.  Divide soap into two bowls and add ground oats to one bowl.  Pour and swirl the two soaps into the mold.

## Batch Notes
Remember to leave soaps with honey as an ingredient uncovered and uninsulated to prevent cracking when the soap begins to cure.  If cracking begins to occur you may even try putting the soap in the refrigerator for a while until the soap cools completely. The overall bar smells sweet, but I can't discern the tea tree or sweet orange fragrance after a week.  Next time I would add more fragrance.
