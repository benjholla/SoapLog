## Recipe
Pour a few ounces of the olive oil into a blender and add the basil. Blend well into a pesto. In separate bowl combine the essential oils, French green clay, pesto, and poppy seeds. Combine the remaining oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Stir in the lye water to the oils, then add the bowl of the pesto mixture. Blend well until trace and pour into mold.

## Batch Notes
No idea how the basil is going to perform here. Some recipes called for half the amount of dried basil, which looked nice. I imagine the Fresh pesto mixture will oxidize so I added some french green clay to counter balance that effect a bit later. The lemongrass-litsea smell is nice, but I think the litsea could be replaced with basil essential oil. After a week there hasn't been any discoloration of the soap yet (see photographs).

I was partially inspired by [this recipe](http://www.sincerelykinsey.com/2013/03/homemade-lemon-herb-soap-clean-living.html).
