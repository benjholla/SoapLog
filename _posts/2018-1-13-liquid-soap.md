## Recipe
Combine the liquid glycerin and distilled water. Combine oils in a crock pot and bring to 160 degrees (+- 10 degrees is fine). Bring the oils up to heat and add the lye water. Bring to a heavy trace. Cook for one day and perform cup test (1 oz. paste in 2 oz. boiling water should be clear) to check that water is clear. Add distilled water and let sit (heated) until dissolved. Add small increments of distilled water until soap skin stops forming. Neutralize with a solution of 2 oz. citric acid with 8 oz of boiling water at a rate of 1.5 oz. per pound of soap paste.

## Batch Notes
This took a really long time and made about 1 gallon of liquid soap base. Optionally the liquid glycerin could be replaced with distilled water. This recipe referenced [https://www.thespruce.com/basic-liquid-soap-recipe-516965](https://www.thespruce.com/basic-liquid-soap-recipe-516965) and [http://www.humblebeeandme.com/how-to-make-liquid-soap-easy-way/](http://www.humblebeeandme.com/how-to-make-liquid-soap-easy-way/). Final PH was measured at about 8.5.
