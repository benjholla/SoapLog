## Recipe
Combine oils, saving the melted shea butter to mix with the essential oils (real men know how to moisturize). At a light trace stir in the essential oil and then split into two bowls and add the charcoal powder to one bowl and the green clay to other bowl. Split the coarse bentonite clay between the two bowls and mix well. Swirl the two soaps together in the mold.

## Batch Notes
To clean the bacon fat I first poured the hot fat through a coffee filter into a mason jar to save in the fridge until I had enough for the recipie. Later I boiled the fat in water (heat water and fat together and bring to a boil) and allowed to cool, saving the fat that floated on top of the water. The result was an a slightly off-white fat that still had some bacon-smoke smell left. If you want to remove the meat smells, I've heard boiling with a tablespoon or two of baking powder is a tried and true method. For this recipie about of third of the pig tallow came from commecial lard (which had been rendered with much more care than my bacon drippings).

The cedarwood and dark patchouli along with the smokey bacon fat makes for a very manly smell. It conjures images of a burly lumberjack cooking bacon in a cast iron pan out in his log house cabin in the woods.
