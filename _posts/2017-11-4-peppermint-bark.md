## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in the fragrance and colorant into the oil (dividing the batch into equal amounts of white and red colored soap). Pour into mold. Release the soap from the mold and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
We tried two arrangements for this soap. In the first arrangement I cut the red soap into thin sheets and placed them vertically in the loaf mold. I then poured the white in between the thin sheets hoping to cause a sort of candy cane-like effect. The second arrangement was similar to the [Marble Soap](./marble-soap/), where I cut the red into randomly sized pieces and mixed them into the white soap.
