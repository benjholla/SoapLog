## Recipe
Dissolve silk in hot lye water. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in fragrance oil. Split batch into two and mix in clays to each, then swirl and pour into mold. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
The scent is complex and at first seemed like too much, but give it a few weeks to mellow out and its a great man soap. The dragon's blood has an incense smell that adds a subtle deep complexity that is enjoyable and no overpowering once it has mellowed out.
