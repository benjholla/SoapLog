## Recipe
Combine all oils except for the shea butter, leaving the shea butter aside to combine with the fragrance oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Before combining the lye water and oils, heat the oils to ~100 degrees Fahrenheit and add the powdered goat's milk.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Stir in the shea butter and fragrance oils set aside earlier and then separate the batch into five equal portions adding one of the Brazilian packets clay to each portion.  Pour a bit of each mixture into the mold overlapping each color until the mold is full. Add a swirl by dragging a skewer back and forth through the mold.

## Batch Notes
The red Brazilian clay was a very nice burgundy color. I really like the dragon's blood fragrance, it's a nice smell and was easy to work with behaving well in cold process soap making.
