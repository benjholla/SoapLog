## Recipe
Pour the mead into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. After boiling for 10 minutes place in freezer to chill until partially frozen. Note additional mead will be required due to boil off or distilled water can be used to bring the liquid solution up to 12.16 ounces. Slowly combine lye and mead until lye is fully dissolved. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in the fragrance and colorant into the oil (dividing the batch into equal amounts of tan and black colored soap). Swirl colors in the bowl and pour into mold. Release the soap from the mold and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
The boiled mead was partially frozen when combined with lye. It darkened a lot due to the caramelizing sugars, but did not cause any issues with the soap tracing. The tan clay was added to the entire batch, while the charcoal powder was added to just half the batch.
