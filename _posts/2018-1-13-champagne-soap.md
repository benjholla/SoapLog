## Recipe
This recipe was originally based off of the recipe shared at [soapqueen.com](https://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/castile-cold-process-soap-tutorial/). It's modified by replacing the distilled water with champagne.

## Batch Notes
Using the sodium lactate and 20% water discount, I reached a heavy trace very quickly. Boil the champagne in a small saucepan for 10 minutes to remove the alcohol. Dilute with distilled water if needed to bring to the 9.73 ounces and chill until partially frozen in the freezer. Slowly combine with lye to minimize scorching sugars.
