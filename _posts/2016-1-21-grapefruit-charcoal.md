## Recipe
Combine oils, saving about an ounce of olive oil to mix with the essential oil. At a light trace add the charcoal powder. Right before pouring the soap into the mold add the essential oil mixed in with the ounce of olive oil and hand stir.

## Batch Notes
Somehow I totally messed up the ratios of each oil when I printed the recipie and didn't notice until it was too late. I actually meant to use 50% olive oil, 30% coconut oil, 15% shea butter, and 5% castor oil.  On a positive note the grapefruit essential oil played really nice and smelled awesome.
