## Recipe
Combine oils, saving about an ounce of olive oil to mix with the essential oil. At a light trace add the charcoal powder. Right before pouring the soap into the mold add the essential oil mixed in with the ounce of olive oil and hand stir.

## Batch Notes
Somehow I totally messed up the percentages of each oil addition when I printed the recipe and didn't notice until it was too late. I actually meant to use 50% olive oil, 30% coconut oil, 15% Shea butter, and 5% castor oil. It looks like the recipe will still turn out alright, even though its not what I originally intended. The only problem is the resulting recipe is pretty low on the recommended range for cleansing that means we should get a very mild soap with a recipe formulation more similar to African Black soap, which might not be such a bad thing. One other thing to note is the grapefruit essential oil played really nice with cold process soap making and smelled awesome.
