Drizzle the charcoal mixture into the main bowl and add a few swirls by hand. Pour the entire mixture into the soap mold. 

## Batch Notes
The scent of the fragrance inspired this man soap.

As described at [Brambleberry](https://www.brambleberry.com/Beau-Brummel-Cybilla-Fragrance-Oil-P3358.aspx):
> We asked our perfumer to create a scent that reminded us of the Gentlemen's clubs of the 18th century. Tobacco and black tea are the dominate notes with hints of fruit and  spice. This fragrance is heady, masculine and evokes images of the classic well dressed gentleman, [Beau Brummel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brummell).
