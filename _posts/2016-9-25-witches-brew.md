## Recipe
Combine all oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Add the Indian healing clay powder and fragrance oils, blending well. Split the mixture into three containers, leaving half of the mixture in the original mixing bowl. For the two smaller bowls, each one fourth of the original mixture, add the charcoal powder to one and the burgundy pigment to the other. Drizzle pour the two colored mixtures back into the mixing bowl and then add a figure eight swirl the combined mixture before pouring into the mold. Let the mold sit overnight before cutting and let cure for four weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
Make sure to the chill the tea mixture before adding the lye. The Burdock root must be boiled and simmered for 10-20 minutes to make the tea.
