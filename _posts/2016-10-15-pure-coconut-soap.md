## Recipe
This recipe was based off of the following recipes shared at [soapqueen.com](https://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/cold-process-soap/defying-the-rules-of-soapmaking-100-coconut-oil-soap-with-aloe-vera-and-a-mantra-swirl/) and [mommypotamus.com](http://www.mommypotamus.com/how-to-make-pure-coconut-oil-soap-for-cleansing-and-laundry/).

## Batch Notes
I combined the lye mixture and coconut oils at around 140 degrees Fahrenheit. I love the mixture of the lemongrass and spearmint, very refreshing. I use the yellow colorant to make a bright green color, but a swirl of the two colors would be nice too.
