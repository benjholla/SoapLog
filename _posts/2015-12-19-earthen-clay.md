## Recipe
Combine mint essential oil with 19.6 ounces of olive oil. Combine distilled rose water with 15.58 ounces distilled water. At trace add french green clay and bentonite.

## Batch Notes
The homemade mint essential oil was made by soaking homegrown mint leaves in a jar of olive oil for 3 days, but it seems to have contributed nothing noticeable to the final soap aroma.  Neither did the homemade distilled rose water for that matter.

I had quite a few scraps left over with the mold I used, so some of this was later rebatched with the [Man Soap (Cabin in the Woods)](/SoapLog/cabin-in-the-woods/).
