## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in the colorants and fragrance oil. At a medium trace hand stir in the poppy seeds. Pour into mold. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
This soap smells delicious. The soap came out a bit soft, but eventually hardened up after about 2 weeks. Probably the water could have been slightly discounted or a little less superfatting to balance the large amount of fragrance oils added.
