## Recipe
Using distilled water prepare a strong batch of tea using the chamomile and peppermint teabags.  After steeping tea let the brew sit in the refrigerator with the tea bags for several hours and then strain the tea.  Top off the tea with distilled water to make the lye solution.  At a light trace add the sodium bentonite and then split the batch in half.  To one half add the activated charcoal. To the other batch add the Moroccan red clay powder and the Indian healing clay powder. Swirl the two colors in the mold for visual effect.

## Batch Notes
We went through a few iterations with this recipe, ultimately removing a 1-ounce addition of a 50/50 Japanese lotus blossom and lilac fragrance oil blend that smelled great, but was causing the soap to rice and seize immediately. We ended up adding peppermint to the chamomile tea and not using any fragrance oils, which gave us plenty of time to swirl the two colors.
