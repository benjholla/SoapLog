## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Stir in the colorants and fragrance oil. Pour into mold. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
This soap has a slight earthy smell from the carrot seed oil. The batch took a long time to come to trace.
