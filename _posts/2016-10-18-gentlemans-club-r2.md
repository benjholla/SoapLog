## Recipe
Combine all oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Add the fragrance oils and blend well. Pour a fifth of the batch into a separate bowl and add the charcoal powder. Add the clays and ground oatmeal to what is remaining. Drizzle the charcoal mixture into the main bowl and add a few swirls by hand. Pour the entire mixture into the soap mold. 

## Batch Notes
My batch of [Man Soap (18th Century Gentleman's Club)](/SoapLog/gentlemans-club/) has been one of my favorite soaps to use and give away so far, but many people I know don't like the idea of animal fats in soap even though I think it makes wonderful soap. This revision was an attempt to reproduce the recipe without using animal fats. This time I also decided to double down on the moisturizing properties since the 18th Century Gentleman's Club fragrance was so inspired by the dandy [Beau Brummel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brummell).
