## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Split mixture into two bowls. Use the stick blender to stir in the blue and yellow colorants into one bowl and the titanium dioxide and green clay powder in the other bowl. Pour all of one bowl into the mold and the pour the second bowl on top. Use a spoon to gently push a bit of the top color down into the bottom color. Let the batch sit overnight. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.


## Batch Notes
This fragrance caused the soap to trace very quickly. We didn't get it as mixed as we would have liked and there was some minor color separation in the soap and was difficult to get into the mold without trapping air little air pockets. It did make an interesting pattern however and the soap is just fine. I enjoy the scent.
