## Recipe
Prepare half of the oils and make a black soap colored soap using the charcoal. Let cure for a few days and then cut into small random shapes. Prepare the remaining oils and make a white colored soap using the titanium dioxide pigment. After the white soap is at trace add the black soap fragments and hand stir to make sure the black soap bits are all covered. Pour the mixture into the soap mold. The essential oils and sodium lactate was split evenly between the two batches. Make sure to add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water before mixing with the oils.

## Batch Notes
This soap came out really cool. The black and white soaps contrast really well and making the soap in two batches made sure the lines were really sharp when we cut the soap. I particularly like the top of the soap where a few chunks of the black soap protruded. The essential oil blend was really well balanced and worked well in cold process soap.
