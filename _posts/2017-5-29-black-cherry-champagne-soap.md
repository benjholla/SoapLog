## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Stir in the fragrances, clays, and colorants to the oil. Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Pour into mold. Release the soap from the mold and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
Since two fragrances often smell less strong when combined and 1.62 ounces of each fragrance individually was considered a strong fragrance for this soap we used an ounce of each fragrance to make a strong black cherry-Champagne fragrance. The resulting fragrance paired nicely together.
