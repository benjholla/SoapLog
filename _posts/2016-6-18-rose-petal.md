## Recipe
Combine all oils. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Add the red clay powder and fragrance oils, blending well. Hand stir in the rose petals. Pour the mixture into the soap mold. 

## Batch Notes
The saffron and honey fragrance oil is a mellow sweet smell. I got it as a sampler with some other fragrances and thought it would pair well with the roses as very light scent in the soap.
