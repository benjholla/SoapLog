## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Stir in the clays and fragrance oil. Split mixture into two bowls. Use the stick blender to stir in the pink and purple colorants into each bowl. Swirl the colors together in the mold. Let the batch sit overnight. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
I was really happy with how this soap came out. The fragrance is delicious smelling and the texture of the soap is great.
