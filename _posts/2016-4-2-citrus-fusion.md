## Recipe
Combine oils, saving about an ounce or two of melted shea butter to mix with the essential oil. At a light trace stir in the essential oil and then split into two bowls and add the Indian healing clay to one bowl and the red clay to other bowl. Split the coarse bentonite clay between the two bowls and mix well. Swirl the two soaps together in the mold.

## Batch Notes
The grapefruit and sweet orange essential oil smelled amazing. I wanted to eat it.
