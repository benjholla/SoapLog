## Recipe
Empty the red bull into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. After boiling for 10 minutes dilute with distilled water until reaching 12.16 ounces and place in freezer to chill until partially frozen. Slowly combine lye and red bull until lye is fully dissolved. Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Stir in the fragrance and colorant into the oil (dividing the batch into equal amounts of white and red colored soap). Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a trace. Pour into mold. Release the soap from the mold and let cure for 4 weeks before using.

## Batch Notes
We tried two arrangements for this soap. In the first arrangement I cut the red soap into thin sheets and placed them vertically in the loaf mold. I then poured the white in between the thin sheets hoping to cause a sort of candy cane-like effect. The second arrangement was similar to the [Marble Soap](./marble-soap/), where I cut the red into randomly sized pieces and mixed them into the white soap.
