## Recipe
Add the sodium lactate to the cooled lye water mixture.  Add the lye water to the oils and bring to a very light trace. Use the stick blender to stir in the course bentonite, pigment, and lavender essential oils. Hand stir in the dried lavender.  Pour the batch into a mold and let sit overnight. Cut the soap bars and let cure for 4 weeks before using.


## Batch Notes
At first I thought the colorant wasn't going to be enough to make any difference, but once the soap set it seemed to be just the right amount.

**Update 12-20-2016:** I made this batch again following the same recipe and it came out more purple this time. It looks like the whole batch gelled a bit more.

**Update 1-30-2017:** Tried this with half lavendar and half lemongrass oil, but the lemongrass oil is a bit too astringent. I also tried halfing the teaspoon measurement of purple mica but it was far too light.
